				  <br>Got some extra time... so why not develop more on my personal website/CMS system? Currently designing this using a series of static HTML pages, but it is beginning to get complex and the content publishing scripts that I want to write will likely get pretty nasty. I may migrate to a sql server based system so it plays nice with PHP.
